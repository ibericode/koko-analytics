#### Is Koko Analytics privacy-friendly?

Yes.

- No personal data is processed or stored.
- Visitors are not tracked across pages or sites.

- No third-party services are involved.

Read more about why [Koko Analytics is privacy-friendly](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/privacy-focused-wordpress-analytics/).

#### Is Koko Analytics lightweight? Will it slow down my site?
